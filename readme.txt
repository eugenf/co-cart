A REST-API for WooCommerce that enables the ability to add, view, update and delete items from the cart.

== Description ==

[WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) REST API is great but it's missing one important endpoint that allows you to manage the cart.

That's were [CoCart](https://cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart) comes in. It creates requests for the cart the same way requests via direct URL or Ajax are handled allowing you to add, remove, restore and update items to and from the cart.

= Built with Developers in Mind =

CoCart is created for developers in mind and allows you to use WooCommerce's REST API to it's full potential. This also provides the option to create a full app for your WooCommerce store.

Intrigued? _I bet you are._ [See documentation](https://co-cart.github.io/co-cart-docs/) on how to use CoCart today.

= Need Support? =

At this time I can **NOT** provide support. [See support](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart#-support) for details. If you [post a ticket](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce/) via the community support forum, a member of the community maybe able to help you.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

Visit the [WooCommerce server requirements documentation](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/server-requirements/) for a detailed list of server requirements.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of CoCart, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "CoCart" and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I access the cart endpoints? =
All can be explained via the API [documentation](https://co-cart.github.io/co-cart-docs/).

= Does it work with any of the official WooCommerce libraries? =
I'm afraid not. This is because the libraries require authentication which the cart does not require.

= Can I view any customers cart? =
No. Only the one in session, just as you would view the cart via the site.

= Where can I report bugs or contribute to the project? =
Bugs can be reported either in the community support forum or preferably on the [CoCart GitHub repository](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues).

= Where can I ask for help? =
Please reach out via the official [support forum on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce/).
